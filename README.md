# Poker Outs Calculator PWA

A Progressive Web Application that calculates accurate poker hand probabilities based on outs and the number of players at the table. Unlike traditional shortcuts like the "Rule of 4 and 2", this calculator provides precise percentages that account for multi-way pots.

- **Progressive Web App**: Install to home screen for offline access
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between themes for comfortable viewing

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Architecture**: Single-page application (SPA)
- **Styling**: BEM methodology with shadcn/ui inspired design
- **PWA Features**: Service worker, manifest file, offline support
- **Build Tool**: Bun for development server

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/poker-outs.git
cd poker-outs

# Install development dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bunx http-server . -p 8080
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` to view the application.

## How It Works

### Probability Formulas

**Before Turn (2 cards to come):**
```
1 - ((cardsLeft-outs)/cardsLeft) Ã— ((cardsLeft-1-outs)/(cardsLeft-1))
```

**Before River (1 card to come):**
```
outs/cardsLeft
```

**Cards remaining calculation:**
- 2 players: 45 cards after flop, 44 after turn
- 3 players: 43 cards after flop, 42 after turn
- Each additional player reduces available cards by 2

### Example: Flush Draw (9 outs)
- **2 players**: 36.4% (before turn)
- **9 players**: 48.1% (before turn)
- **Difference**: +11.7% higher odds in full ring vs heads-up
